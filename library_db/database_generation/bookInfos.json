Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. \r\n\r\nSet amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. \r\n\r\nAllie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. \r\n\r\nLike a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. \r\n\r\n\"I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.\" \r\n\r\nAnd so begins one of the most poignant and compelling love stories you will ever read...The Notebook", "identifiers": {}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Warner Books"], "revision": 4}, {"title": "Life of Pi", "authors": ["Yann Martel"], "subjects": ["Teenage boys", "Zoo animals", "Fiction", "Literature", "Tigers", "Translations into Korean", "Tiger", "award:man_booker_prize=2002", "Man Booker Prize Winner", "Open Library Staff Picks", "Orphans", "Survival after airplane accidents, shipwrecks", "Storytelling", "Ocean travel", "Ithaca College First-Year Reading Initiative", "Shipwreck survival", "English fiction", "Human-animal relationships", "Integracji i Globalizacji Centrum Badawcze Transformacji", "Fictional Works Publication Type", "Religion", "Relations homme-animal", "Adventure fiction", "Schiffbruch", "Romans, nouvelles, etc. pour la jeunesse", "Human-animal relationship", "\u00dcberleben", "Survie apr\u00e8s accidents d'avion, naufrages", "M\u00e4nnliche Jugend", "Teenagers", "Animal Population Groups", "Z\u00e4hmung", "Faszination", "Romans, nouvelles", "Indischer Jugendlicher", "Survival at sea", "Fiction, action & adventure", "Fiction, psychological", "Large type books", "Shipwreck victims", "nyt:trade-fiction-paperback=2012-10-21", "New York Times bestseller", "Romans", "Aventures", "Naufrag\u00e9s", "Tigres", "Pacifique, Oc\u00e9an", "Novela psicol\u00f3gica", "Muchachos adolescentes", "Narraci\u00f3n de cuentos", "Relatos de aventura", "Viajes por mar", "Relaciones hombre-animal", "Supervivencia (despu\u00e9s de accidentes a\u00e9reos, naufragios, etc.)", "Animales zool\u00f3gicos", "Ficci\u00f3n", "Hu\u00e9rfanos", "Survival", "Readers", "Action & Adventure", "LITERARY CRITICISM", "American", "General", "Life of Pi (Martel, Yann)", "Psychological fiction", "Adventure stories"], "description": "After the tragic sinking of a cargo ship, one solitary lifeboat remains bobbing on the wild, blue Pacific.

At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple's hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. - Publisher."}, "identifiers": {}, "publishers": ["Dogan Kitap"], "revision": 5, "number_of_pages": 540}, {"title": "Bossypants", "authors": ["Tina Fey"], "subjects": ["Women comedians", "Comedians, biography", "Television personalities", "American wit and humor", "Comedians, united states", "Women television personalities", "Biography", "nyt:e-book-nonfiction=2011-04-24", "New York Times bestseller", "Comedians"], "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Little, Brown Book Group Limited"], "publish_date": "2011", "revision": 2}, {"title": "City of glass", "authors": ["Cassandra Clare"], "subjects": ["Magic", "Vampires", "Juvenile fiction", "Clary Fray (Fictitious character)", "Demonology", "Fiction", "Children's fiction", "Magic, fiction", "Demonology, fiction", "Vampires, fiction", "Supernatural, fiction", "New york (n.y.), fiction"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Discover more secrets about the Shadowhunters as they fight to protect the world from demons in the third book in the internationally bestselling series.

Marie Laure lives with her father in Paris within walking distance of the Museum of Natural History where he works as the master of the locks (there are thousands of locks in the museum). When she is six, she goes blind, and her father builds her a model of their neighborhood, every house, every manhole, so she can memorize it with her fingers and navigate the real streets with her feet and cane. When the Germans occupy Paris, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast, where Marie-Laure's agoraphobic great uncle lives in a tall, narrow house by the sea wall. In another world in Germany, an orphan boy, Werner, grows up with his younger sister, Jutta, both enchanted by a crude radio Werner finds. He becomes a master at building and fixing radios, a talent that wins him a place at an elite and brutal military academy and, ultimately, makes him a highly specialized tracker of the Resistance. Werner travels through the heart of Hitler Youth to the far-flung outskirts of Russia, and finally into Saint-Malo, where his path converges with Marie-Laure. Doerr's gorgeous combination of soaring imagination with observation is electric. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? How did the legalization of abortion affect the rate of violent crime?\r\n\r\nThese may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much-heralded scholar who studies the riddles of everyday life\u2014from cheating and crime to sports and child-rearing\u2014and whose conclusions turn the conventional wisdom on its head.\r\n\r\nFreakonomics is a ground-breaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They usually begin with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: Freakonomics.\r\n\r\nThrough forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives\u2014how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they explore the hidden side of \u2026 well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.\r\n\r\nWhat unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a great deal of complexity and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and\u2014if the right questions are asked\u2014is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking at things.\r\n\r\nFreakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. ButFreakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the U.S. in 2005, Freakonomics went on to sell more than 4 million copies around the world, in 35 languages. It also inspired a follow-up book, SuperFreakonomics; a high-profile documentary film; a radio program, and an award-winning blog, which has been called \u201cthe most readable economics blog in the universe.\u201d\r\n\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://freakonomics.com/books/"}, "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["1022022"], "librarything": ["675"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Harper Perennial"], "revision": 15, "number_of_pages": 320}, {"title": "The Battle of the Labyrinth", "authors": ["Rick Riordan"], "subjects": ["Greek mythology in fiction", "Mythical animals in fiction", "Greek Mythology", "Juvenile fiction", "Labyrinths in fiction", "Fiction", "Monsters in fiction", "Labyrinths", "Camps", "Titans (Mythology)", "Monsters", "Mythical Animals", "Camps in fiction", "Percy Jackson (Fictitious character)", "Children's fiction", "Gods, fiction", "Fantasy fiction", "Teenage boys", "Mothers", "School Library Journal Best Book of the Year (2005)", "Quests (Expeditions)", "Fathers and sons", "Teenagers", "Prophecies", "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder", "Dyslexics", "Friendship", "Single mothers", "Satyrs (Greek mythology)", "Camps, fiction", "Monsters, fiction", "Animals, mythical, fiction", "Young Adult Fiction", "Large type books", "Greek Gods", "Fantasy", "Percy Jackson (fictional character)", "children's books", "thieves", "adventure", "quests", "Mythology", "boarding school", "Mythology-juvenile fiction, boarding school, quests, thieves, adventure, monsters", "Accelerated Reader", "Mythologie grecque", "Romans, nouvelles, etc. pour la jeunesse", "Labyrinthes", "Colonies de vacances", "Monstres", "Animaux fabuleux", "Titans (Mythologie)", "Griekse oudheid", "Jeugdboeken ; verhalen", "Laberintos", "Spanish language materials", "Animales fabulosos", "Ficci\u00f3n juvenil", "Mitolog\u00eda griega", "Monstruos", "Campamentos"], "description": "Percy Jackson isn't expecting freshman orientation to be any fun, but when a mysterious mortal acquaintance appears, pursued by demon cheerleaders, things quickly go from bad to worse.

Tolkien's three-volume epic, is set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth -- home to many strange beings, and most notably hobbits, a peace-loving \"little people,\" cheerful and shy. Since its original British publication in 1954-55, the saga has entranced readers of all ages. It is at once a classic myth and a modern fairy tale. Critic Michael Straight has hailed it as one of the \"very few works of genius in recent literature.\" Middle-earth is a world receptive to poets, scholars, children, and all other people of good will. Donald Barr has described it as \"a scrubbed morning world, and a ringing nightmare world...especially sunlit, and shadowed by perils very fundamental, of a peculiarly uncompounded darkness.\" The story of this world is one of high and heroic adventure. Barr compared it to Beowulf, C.S. Lewis to Orlando Furioso, W.H. Auden to The Thirty-nine Steps. In fact the saga is sui generis -- a triumph of imagination which springs to life within its own framework and on its own terms. - Jacket flap.\r\n\r\nFrodo and the Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in the battle with an evil spirit in the Mines of Moria; and at the Falls of Rauros, Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape the rest of the company were attacked by Orcs. Now they continue their journey alone down the great River Anduin \u2013 alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go. J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s great work of imaginative fiction has been labelled both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Also contained in:**\r\n\r\n - [The Lord of the Rings][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27448W/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "identifiers": {}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Houghton Mifflin Company"], "publish_date": "19xx?", "revision": 6, "number_of_pages": 352}, {"title": "Dune", "authors": ["Frank Herbert"], "subjects": ["Dune (Imaginary place)", "Fiction", "Fiction, science fiction, general", "Dune (imaginary place), fiction", "New York Times reviewed", "Science fiction", "Science-fiction", "American literature", "nyt:mass-market-monthly=2021-11-07", "New York Times bestseller", "award:nebula_award=novel", "nyt:trade-fiction-paperback=2021-11-07", "Hugo Award Winner", "award:hugo_award=1966", "award:hugo_award=novel"], "description": "Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the \"spice\" melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness.

Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\" So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland.  in the 1930s and 40s. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy -- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling -- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors -- yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. - Jacket flap.", "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Twenty-Third Avenue Books and First Choice Books"], "publish_places": ["New York"], "revision": 2}, {"title": "Persuasion", "authors": ["Jane Austen"], "subjects": ["Fiction, Romance, Historical, Regency", "Love stories, English", "Mo\u0161ki in \u017eenske", "V leposlovju", "Medosebni odnosi", "Dru\u017ebene razmere", "Ship captains", "Social life and customs", "Motherless families", "First loves", "Rejection (Psychology)", "Officers", "Great Britain.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.\r\n\r\nRanging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.\r\n\r\nMost of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \u201cBy excluding the human factor, aren\u2019t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it?

From this plot emerged some of Steinbeck\u2019s most fascinating characters \u2013 many of whom are modeled after people in his own life.\r\n\r\nPart allegory, part autobiography, and part epic, East of Eden was an ambitious project from the start \u2013 a gift to Steinbeck\u2019s sons that was meant to teach them about identity, grief, and what it means to be human. Tinged with biblical echoes of the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Abel, this sprawling saga has captivated audiences everywhere for generations.

Jonathan Safran Foer emerged as one of the most original writers of his generation with his best-selling debut novel, Everything Is Illuminated. Now, with humor, tenderness, and awe, he confronts the traumas of our recent history. What he discovers is solace in that most human quality, imagination. Meet Oskar Schell, an inventor, Francophile, tambourine player, Shakespearean actor, jeweler, pacifist, correspondent with Stephen Hawking and Ringo Starr. He is nine years old. And he is on an urgent, secret search through the five boroughs of New York. His mission is to find the lock that fits a mysterious key belonging to his father, who died in the World Trade Center on 9/11. An inspired innocent, Oskar is alternately endearing, exasperating, and hilarious as he careens from Central Park to Coney Island to Harlem on his search. Along the way he is always dreaming up inventions to keep those he loves safe from harm. What about a birdseed shirt to let you fly away? What if you could actually hear everyone's heartbeat? His goal is hopeful, but the past speaks a loud warning in stories of those who've lost loved ones before. As Oskar roams New York, he encounters a motley assortment of humanity who are all survivors in their own way. He befriends a 103-year-old war reporter, a tour guide who never leaves the Empire State Building, and lovers enraptured or scorned. Ultimately, Oskar ends his journey where it began, at his father's grave. But now he is accompanied by the silent stranger who has been renting the spare room of his grandmother's apartment.

She rapidly learns the insane amount of juggling involved to ensure that a Park Avenue wife who doesn't work, cook, clean, or raise her own child has a smooth day. When the X's' marriage begins to disintegrate, Nanny ends up involved way beyond the bounds of human decency or good taste. Her tenure with the X family becomes a nearly impossible mission to maintain the mental health of their four-year-old, her own integrity and, most importantly, her sense of humor.

It is the story--set in post-Civil War Ohio--of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked death in order to wrench herself from a living death; who has lost a husband and buried a child; who has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad: a woman of \"iron eyes and backbone to match.\" Sethe lives in a small house on the edge of town with her daughter, Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, mesmerizing intruder who calls herself Beloved. Sethe works at \"beating back the past,\" but it is alive in all of them. It keeps Denver fearful of straying from the house. It fuels the sadness that has settled into Baby Suggs' \"desolated center where the self that was no self made its home.\" And to Sethe, the past makes itself heard and felt incessantly: in memories that both haunt and soothe her...in the arrival of Paul D (\"There was something blessed in his manner. Women saw him and wanted to weep\"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the \"place over there\" to claim retribution for what she lost and for what was taken from her. Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance.

The levity with which you assumed this frightful responsibility has probably by this time enabled you to forget it; but the day of reckoning has arrived: here is your play! I say your play, because qui facit per alium facit per se. Its profits, like its labor, belong to me: its morals, its manners, its philosophy, its influence on the young, are for you to justify. You were of mature age when you made the suggestion; and you knew your man. It is hardly fifteen years since, as twin pioneers of the New Journalism of that time, we two, cradled in the same new sheets, made an epoch in the criticism of the theatre and the opera house by making it a pretext for a propaganda of our own views of life. So you cannot plead ignorance of the character of the force you set in motion. Yon meant me to epater le bourgeois; and if he protests, I hereby refer him to you as the accountable party.  I warn you that if you attempt to repudiate your responsibility, I shall suspect you of finding the play too decorous for your taste. The fifteen years have made me older and graver. In you I can detect no such becoming change. Your levities and audacities are like the loves and comforts prayed for by Desdemona: they increase, even as your days do grow. No mere pioneering journal dares meddle with them now: the stately Times itself is alone sufficiently above suspicion to act as your chaperone; and even the Times must sometimes thank its stars that new plays are not produced every day, since after each such event its gravity is compromised, its platitude turned to epigram, its portentousness to wit, its propriety to elegance, and even its decorum into naughtiness by criticisms which the traditions of the paper do not allow you to sign at the end, but which you take care to sign with the most extravagant flourishes between the lines. I am not sure that this is not a portent of Revolution. In eighteenth century France the end was at hand when men bought the Encyclopedia and found Diderot there.

And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.\r\n\r\nEnter Mia Warren \u2013 an enigmatic artist and single mother \u2013 who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.\r\n\r\nWhen old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides.  Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs. \r\n\r\nLittle Fires Everywhere explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, and the ferocious pull of motherhood \u2013 and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitnessing these two families as they commingle and clash is an utterly engrossing, often heartbreaking, deeply empathetic experience\u2026 It\u2019s this vast and complex network of moral affiliations\u2014and the nuanced omniscient voice that Ng employs to navigate it\u2014that make this novel even more ambitious and accomplished than her debut\u2026 The magic of this novel lies in its power to implicate all of its characters\u2014and likely many of its readers\u2014in that innocent delusion [of a post-racial America].

But there is a heartening optimism, too. This is a book that believes in the transformative powers of art and genuine kindness \u2014 and in the promise of new growth, even after devastation, even after everything has turned to ash.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014BOSTON GLOBE \r\n\ud83d\udd25\r\n\r\n\u201c[Ng] widens her aperture to include a deeper, more diverse cast of characters. Though the book\u2019s language is clean and straightforward, almost conversational, Ng has an acute sense of how real people (especially teenagers, the slang-slinging kryptonite of many an aspiring novelist) think and feel and communicate. Shaker Heights may be a place where \u2018things were peaceful, and riots and bombs and earthquakes were quiet thumps, muffled by distance.\u2019 But the real world is never as far away as it seems, of course. And if the scrim can\u2019t be broken, sometimes you have to burn it down.

When her ne'er-do-well father learns that his family is the last of a long noble line, the d'Urbervilles, he sends Tess on a journey to meet her supposed kin\u2014a journey that will see her victimized by lust, poverty, and hypocrisy. Shaped by an acute sense of social injustice and by a vision of human fate cosmic in scope, her story is a singular blending of harsh realism and poignant beauty.

Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed. Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern -- and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year. An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees -- how they approach worker safety -- and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones. What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits. In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warrens Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nations largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits arent destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives. - Publisher."}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Penguin Random House"], "publish_date": "2012", "revision": 1}, {"title": "Madame Bovary", "authors": ["Gustave Flaubert"], "subjects": ["literary fiction", "French literature", "Fiction", "Manners and customs in fiction", "Adultery", "Middle class", "Physicians' spouses", "Suicide victims", "Married women", "Social life and customs", "French fiction", "Technique", "Suicide", "Husband and wife", "History", "Physicians", "Intellectual life", "Classic Literature", "Spouses", "Country life", "Women", "Manners and customs", "Continental european fiction (fictional works by one author)", "France, fiction", "Physicians, fiction", "Married people, fiction", "Fiction, family life", "Fiction, general", "Trials, litigation", "Literary", "Young men", "Unrequited love", "Romance literature", "Trials (Obscenity)", "Criticism and interpretation", "Criticism", "Wives", "M\u00e9decins", "Romans, nouvelles", "Conjoints", "Suicid\u00e9s", "Married people", "Couples mari\u00e9s", "Vie intellectuelle", "M\u0153urs et coutumes", "Man-woman relationships", "Triangles (Interpersonal relations)", "Relations entre hommes et femmes", "Triangle (Relations humaines)", "Roman fran\u00e7ais", "Chang pian xiao shuo", "Bovary, charles (fictitious character), fiction", "Bovary, emma (fictitious character), fiction", "Emma Bovary (Fictitious character)", "FICTION", "General", "Commerce", "Qing Dynasty (China)"], "description": "Charles Bovary, m\u00e9decin de campagne, veuf d'une m\u00e9g\u00e8re, fait lors d'une tourn\u00e9e la rencontre du p\u00e8re Rouault et de sa fille, Emma.

Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground.

The father, Ronald, is a math teacher at a private school and the mother is a homemaker. The family has five daughters: 13-year-old Cecilia, 14-year-old Lux, 15-year-old Bonnie, 16-year-old Mary, and 17-year-old Therese.\r\n\r\nTheir lives change dramatically within one summer when Cecilia, a stoic and astute girl described as an \"outsider\", attempts suicide by cutting her wrists. A few weeks later, the girls throw a chaperoned party, during which Cecilia jumps from their second story window and dies, impaled by a fence post.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Cecilia's suicide and its after-effects on the family are popular subjects of neighborhood gossip. The mystique of the Lisbon girls operates also for the neighborhood boys, the narrators of the novel.\r\n\r\nLux begins a romance with local heartthrob Trip Fontaine. Trip negotiates with the overprotective Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon to take Lux to a homecoming dance, on the condition that he finds dates for the other three girls. After having sex with Trip on the high school football field after the dance, Lux misses her curfew. Consequently, the Lisbons become recluses. Mrs. Lisbon pulls all the girls out of school, claiming that it would help the girls recover from Cecilia's suicide. However, despite her attempt to protect the girls from boys and sex, over the winter, Lux is seen having sex with various unknown men on the roof nightly. A few months after Lux is sent to the hospital because of a pregnancy scare\u2014which her parents were told was simply indigestion\u2014Mr. Lisbon officially takes a leave of absence. Their house falls into a deeper state of disrepair; none of them leave the house and no one visits, not even to deliver milk and groceries. A strange smell coming from the house permeates the neighborhood. From a safe distance, all the people in the neighborhood watch the Lisbons' lives deteriorate, but no one can summon up the courage to intervene.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the Lisbons become increasingly fascinating to the neighborhood in general and the narrator boys in particular. The boys call the Lisbon girls and communicate by playing records over the telephone for the girls.\r\n\r\nFinally, the girls send a message to the boys to come to the house. Shortly after the boys arrive, three of the sisters kill themselves: Bonnie hangs herself, Therese overdoses on sleeping pills, and Lux dies of carbon monoxide poisoning. Mary attempts suicide by putting her head in the oven, but fails. Mary continues to live for another month before successfully ending her life by taking sleeping pills. Newspaper writer Linda Perl notes that the suicides come a year after Cecilia's first attempt. After the suicide \"free-for-all,\" Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon leave the neighborhood. The house is sold to a young couple from the Boston area and most of the Lisbons' personal effects are either thrown out or sold in a garage sale. The narrators scavenge through the trash to collect much of the \"evidence\" they mention. The boys that once loved them from afar are now grown men, determined to understand a tragedy that has always defied explanation.

Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. **Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?**\r\n\r\n**Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: *it's \"a real Creeper!\"*** What distinguishes this particular Hound is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ***\"The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,\" Watson realizes.*** \"Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... **it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.\" Read on--but, reader, watch your step! *--Tim Appelo, Goodreads Review***", "revision": 2}, {"title": "The Clan of the Cave Bear", "authors": ["Jean M.

Though created by a handful of mavericks, the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad. That's a lengthy list of charges, but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning.\r\n\r\nSchlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold America's most dangerous job -- meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers' convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains' efforts to reel in the youngest, most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization -- a phenomenon launched by fast food.\r\n\r\nFAST FOOD NATION is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats."}, "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["1101"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/spa"}], "revision": 10, "number_of_pages": 479}, {"title": "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil", "authors": ["John Berendt"], "subjects": ["Social life and customs", "Trials (Murder)", "True Crime", "Nonfiction", "History", "Celebrities", "Description and travel", "Tours", "Travel", "Williams, Jim, d. 1990", "Williams, Jim,", "Trials, united states", "Savannah (ga.), history", "Murder, georgia", "Georgia, social life and customs", "Large type books", "Manners and customs", "Chang pian xiao shuo", "LGBTQ mystery", "Lambda Literary Awards", "Lambda Literary Award Winner", "Trials (murder)"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Read John Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil in Large Print. All Random House Large Print editions are published in a 16-point typefaceShots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty,early morning hours of May 2, 1981.  Was it murder or self-defense?  For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares.  John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction.  Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the \"soul of pampered self-absorption\"; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight.  These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.  Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story  is a sublime and seductive reading experience.  Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city is certain to become a modern classic.From the Trade Paperback edition."}, "identifiers": {}, "publishers": ["Random"], "publish_date": "January 13, 1994", "revision": 4}, {"title": "The Magician's Nephew", "authors": ["C.

Lydia is the favorite child of Marilyn and James Lee; their middle daughter, a girl who inherited her mother's bright blue eyes and her father's jet-black hair. Her parents are determined that Lydia will fulfill the dreams they were unable to pursue-in Marilyn's case that her daughter become a doctor rather than a homemaker, in James's case that Lydia be popular at school, a girl with a busy social life and the center of every party. When Lydia's body is found in the local lake, the delicate balancing act that has been keeping the Lee family together tumbles into chaos, forcing them to confront the long-kept secrets that have been slowly pulling them apart. James, consumed by guilt, sets out on a reckless path that may destroy his marriage. Marilyn, devastated and vengeful, is determined to find a responsible party, no matter what the cost. Lydia's older brother, Nathan, is certain that the neighborhood bad boy Jack is somehow involved. But it's the youngest of the family-Hannah-who observes far more than anyone realizes and who may be the only one who knows the truth about what happened. A profoundly moving story of family, history, and the meaning of home, Everything I Never Told You is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive family portrait, exploring the divisions between cultures and the rifts within a family, and uncovering the ways in which mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives struggle, all their lives, to understand one another\"-"}, "publishers": ["Little, Brown Book Group Limited"], "publish_date": "Mar 07, 2014", "revision": 4}, {"title": "The Hero of Ages", "authors": ["Brandon Sanderson"], "subjects": ["Fiction", "Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy", "Fantasy fiction", "Fiction, fantasy, general", "Children's fiction", "Imaginary places", "Magic"], "description": "This book is not only the third book in a trilogy, but it\u2019s Act Three of the the three-act structure for the Mistborn Trilogy\u2014it\u2019s the part of the story where the heroes have discovered that what they thought was the problem all along was not the true danger, and now they\u2019re fighting for not only their own survival but that of the world they live in.

Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past -- a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor, and effortless precision -- a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of To Kill a Mockingbird, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context, and new meaning to an American classic. - Jacket."}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["HarperCollins Canada, Limited"], "publish_date": "2015", "revision": 2, "number_of_pages": 288}, {"title": "Thinking, fast and slow", "authors": ["Daniel Kahneman"], "subjects": ["Intuition", "Thought and thinking", "Reasoning", "Decision making", "New York Times bestseller", "nyt:hardcover_business_books=2012-02-25", "Long Now Manual for Civilization", "Thinking", "Kognition", "77.32 intelligence, creativity", "Ta\u0098nkande", "Beslutsfattande", "Besliskunde", "Resonerande", "Psykologiska aspekter", "Emotions and cognition", "Schlussfolgern", "Entscheidungsfindung", "T\u00e4nkande", "New York Times reviewed", "Reason", "Pens\u00e9e", "Prise de d\u00e9cision", "Raison", "\u00c9motions et cognition", "Cognition", "Self-actualization (Psychology)", "Cognitive psychology", "Psychologie cognitive", "Psychology"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Kahneman introduces two modes of thought - system 1, fast and intuitive, and system 2, slow and reasoned - and explores how these modes effect behavior, particularly judgement and decision making."}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Penguin Books, Limited"], "publish_date": "2011", "revision": 3}, {"title": "Slammed", "authors": ["Colleen Hoover"], "subjects": ["Fiction, Romance, Contemporary, Life change events", "Death", "Families", "Poetry slams", "Fathers", "Life change events", "Fiction", "Fiction, romance, general", "Fiction, general", "Crime, fiction", "Fiction, family life", "Teenagers"], "description": "Following the unexpected death of her father, eighteen-year-old Layken is forced to be the rock for both her mother and her younger brother.

The Cavendish household is wrought with tension due to the marriage of John's widowed old aunt Emily, she of a sizeable fortune, to a suspicious younger man, Alfred Inglethorp, twenty years her junior. Emily's two stepsons, John and Lawrence Cavendish, as well as John's wife Mary and several other people, also live at Styles. Late one night, the residents of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying. When Emily's sudden heart attack is found to be attributable to strychnine, Hastings, who had runs into his old friend, the Belgian Hercule Poirot, he recruits him to aid in the local investigation. With impeccable timing, Hercule Poirot, the insightful retired detective, makes his dramatic entrance to solve a most baffling case.\r\n\r\nWho poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorpe, and how did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? Suspects abound in the quaint village of Styles St. Mary--from the heiress's fawning new husband to her two stepsons, her volatile housekeeper, and a pretty nurse who works in a hospital dispensary. On the day she was killed, Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone, most likely her husband, Alfred, or her stepson, John. Afterwards, she seemed quite distressed and, apparently, made a new will--which no one can find. Nobody can explain how or when the strychnine was administered to Mrs. Inglethorp. High on Poirot's list of suspects are: John Cavendish, the elder stepson; Mary Cavendish, his wife; Lawrence Cavendish, the younger stepson; Evelyn Howard, Mrs. Inglethorpe's companion; Cynthia Murdoch, her protegee; and Dr. Bauerstein, a mysterious stranger who lives in Essex.

She is the chief operating officer of Facebook and is ranked on Fortune magazine's list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2010, she gave an electrifying TEDTalk in which she described how women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Her talk, which became a phenomenon and has been viewed more than two million times, encouraged women to \"sit at the table,\" seek challenges, take risks, and pursue their goals with gusto. She digs deeper into these issues, combining personal anecdotes, hard data, and compelling research to cut through the layers of ambiguity and bias surrounding the lives and choices of working women. She recounts her own decisions, mistakes, and daily struggles to make the right choices for herself, her career, and her family. She provides advice on negotiation techniques, mentorship, and building a satisfying career, urging women to set boundaries and to abandon the myth of \"having it all.\" She describes specific steps women can take to combine professional achievement with personal fulfillment and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting women in the workplace and at home.

However, he is soon sold to a slave trader and sent down the Mississippi, where he must endure brutal treatment. This is a powerful tale of the extreme cruelties of slavery, as well as the price of loyalty and morality. When first published, it helped to solidify the anti-slavery sentiments of the North, and it remains today as the book that helped move a nation to civil war.\r\n\r\n\"So this is the little lady who made this big war.\" Abraham Lincoln's legendary comment upon meeting Mrs. Stowe has been seriously questioned, but few will deny that this work fed the passions and prejudices of countless numbers. If it did not \"make\" the Civil Warm, it flamed the embers. That Uncle Tom's Cabin is far more than an outdated work of propaganda confounds literary criticism. The novel's overwhelming power and persuasion have outlived even the most severe of critics. As Professor John William Ward of Amherst College points out in his incisive Afterword, the dilemma posed by Mrs. Stowe is no less relevant today than it was in 1852: What is it to be \"a moral human being\"? Can such a person live in society -- any society? Commenting on the timeless significance of the book, Professor Ward writes: \"Uncle Tom's Cabin is about slavery, but it is about slavery because the fatal weakness of the slave's condition is the extreme manifestation of the sickness of the general society, a society breaking up into discrete, atomistic individuals where human beings, white or black, can find no secure relation one with another. Mrs. Stowe was more radical than even those in the South who hated her could see. Uncle Tom's Cabin suggests no less than the simple and terrible possibility that society has no place in it for love.\" - Back cover.", "identifiers": {}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["P.

It is Thomas's debut novel, expanded from a short story she wrote in college in reaction to the police shooting of Oscar Grant. The book is narrated by Starr Carter, a 16-year-old black girl from a poor neighborhood who attends an elite private school in a predominantly white, affluent part of the city. Starr becomes entangled in a national news story after she witnesses a white police officer shoot and kill her childhood friend, Khalil. She speaks up about the shooting in increasingly public ways, and social tensions culminate in a riot after a grand jury decides not to indict the police officer for the shooting.\r\n\r\nThe Hate U Give was published on February 28, 2017, by HarperCollins imprint Balzer + Bray, which had won a bidding war for the rights to the novel. The book was a commercial success, debuting at number one on The New York Times young adult best-seller list, where it remained for 50 weeks. It won several awards and received critical praise for Thomas's writing and timely subject matter. In writing the novel, Thomas attempted to expand readers' understanding of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as difficulties faced by black Americans who employ code switching. These themes, as well as the vulgar language, attracted some controversy and caused the book to be one of the most challenged books of 2017 and 2018 according to the American Library Association.", "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["59336369"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/cat"}], "publishers": ["fanbooks"], "publish_date": "2017-05", "publish_places": ["Barcelona"], "revision": 8, "number_of_pages": 411}, {"title": "International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology", "authors": ["Kwang W.

Joe escaped from Prague with the help of his teacher Kornblum by hiding in a coffin along with the inanimate Golem of Prague, leaving the rest of his family, including his younger brother Thomas, behind. Besides having a shared interest in drawing, Sammy and Joe share several connections to Jewish stage magician Harry Houdini: Joe (like comics legend Jim Steranko) studied magic and escapology in Prague, which aided him in his departure from Europe, and Sammy is the son of the Mighty Molecule, a strongman on the vaudeville circuit.\r\n\r\nWhen Sammy discovers Joe's artistic talent, Sammy gets Joe a job as an illustrator for a novelty products company, which, due to the recent success of Superman, is attempting to get into the comic-book business. Under the name \"Sam Clay\", Sammy starts writing adventure stories with Joe illustrating them, and the two recruit several other Brooklyn teenagers to produce Amazing Midget Radio Comics (named to promote one of the company's novelty items). The pair is at once passionate about their creation, optimistic about making money, and always nervous about the opinion of their employers. The magazine features Sammy and Joe's character the Escapist, an anti-fascist superhero who combines traits of (among others) Captain America, Harry Houdini, Batman, the Phantom, and the Scarlet Pimpernel. The Escapist becomes tremendously popular, but like talent behind Superman, the writers and artists of the comic get a minimal share of their publisher's revenue. Sammy and Joe are slow to realize that they are being exploited, as they have private concerns: Joe is trying to help his family escape from Nazi-occupied Prague, and has fallen in love with the bohemian Rosa Saks, who has her own artistic aspirations, while Clay is battling with his sexual identity and the lackluster progress of his literary career.\r\n\r\nFor many months after coming to New York, Joe is driven almost solely by an intense desire to improve the condition of his family, still living under a regime increasingly hostile to their kind. This drive shows through in his work, which remains for a long time unabashedly anti-Nazi despite his employer's concerns. In the meantime, he is spending more and more time with Rosa, appearing as a magician in the bar mitzvahs of the children of Rosa's father's acquaintances, even though he sometimes feels guilty at indulging in these distractions from the primary task of fighting for his family. After multiple attempts and considerable monetary sacrifice, Joe ultimately fails to get his family to the States, his last attempt having resulted in putting his younger brother aboard a ship that sank into the Atlantic. Distraught and unaware that Rosa is pregnant with his child, Joe enlists in the navy, hoping to fight the Germans. Instead, he is sent to a lonely, cold naval base in Antarctica, from which he emerges the lone survivor after a series of deaths. When he makes it back to New York, ashamed to show his face again to Rosa and Sammy, he lives and sleeps in a hideout in the Empire State Building, known only to a small circle of magician-friends.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sam battles with his sexuality, shown mostly through his relationship with the radio voice of The Escapist, Tracy Bacon. Bacon's movie-star good-looks initially intimidate Clay, but they later fall in love. When Tracy is cast as The Escapist in the film version, he invites Clay to move to Hollywood with him, an offer that Clay accepts. But later, when Bacon and Clay go to a friend's beach house with several other gay men and couples, the company's private dinner is broken up by the local police as well as two off-duty FBI agents. All of the men are arrested, except for two who hid under the dinner table, one of whom is Clay. The FBI agents each claim one of the men and grant them their freedom in return for sexual favors. After this episode, Clay decides that he can't live with the constant threat of being arrested, ridiculed, and judged because of his sexuality. He does not go with Bacon to the West Coast. Some time after Joe leaves, Sammy marries Rosa and moves with her to the suburbs, where they raise her son Tommy in what outwardly appears to be a typical traditional nuclear family.\r\n\r\nSammy and Rosa cannot hide all their secrets from Tommy, however, who manages to take private magic lessons in the Empire State Building from Joe for the better part of year without anyone else's knowledge. Tommy is instrumental in finally reuniting the Kavalier and Clay duo, which works with renewed enthusiasm to find a new creative direction for comics. Joe moves into Sammy and Rosa's house. Shortly afterwards, Sammy's homosexuality is revealed on public television. This further complicates the attempts of Rosa, Sammy, and Joe to reconstitute a family.\r\n\r\nMany events in the novel are based on the lives of actual comic-book creators including Jack Kirby (to whom the book is dedicated in the afterword), Stan Lee, Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Joe Simon, Will Eisner, and Jim Steranko. Other historical figures play minor roles, including Salvador Dal\u00ed, Al Smith, Orson Welles, and Fredric Wertham. The novel's time span roughly mirrors that of the Golden Age of Comics itself, starting from shortly after the debut of Superman and concluding with the Kefauver Senate hearings, two events often used to demarcate the era.", "identifiers": {"librarything": ["5927"], "goodreads": ["99424"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/spa"}], "revision": 8, "number_of_pages": 736}, {"title": "Anansi Boys", "authors": ["Neil Gaiman", "M\u00f3nica Faerna", "Lenny Henry"], "subjects": ["Action and adventure fiction", "Adventure fiction", "Adventure stories", "brothers", "embezzlement", "English fiction", "estates", "Fantasy", "Fantasy fiction", "Father-son relationship", "Fathers", "fathers and sons", "Fiction", "Fiction, action & adventure", "Fiction, fantasy, contemporary", "Fiction, humorous", "flamingoes", "Gods", "Humorous fiction", "incarnation", "karaoke", "stoats", "talent agencies", "virginity", "Fathers and sons, fiction", "Fiction, humorous, general", "Brothers, fiction", "Fathers and sons", "Brothers", "P\u00e8res et fils", "Romans, nouvelles", "Fr\u00e8res"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Anansi Boys is a fantasy novel by English writer Neil Gaiman.

It is narrated as a series of flashbacks by Juan Rico, and is one of only a few Heinlein novels set out in this fashion.  The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette  Rodger Young, about to embark on a raid against the planet of the \"Skinnies,\" who are allies of the Arachnids. We learn that he is a cap(sule) trooper in the Terran Federation's Mobile Infantry. The raid itself, one of the few instances of actual combat in the novel, is relatively brief: the Mobile Infantry land on the planet, destroy their targets, and retreat, suffering a single casualty in the process.\r\n\r\nThe story then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school, and his decision to sign up for Federal Service over the objections of his father. This is the only chapter that describes Rico's civilian life, and most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired Lt. Col. Jean V. Dubois, Rico's school instructor in \"History and Moral Philosophy,\" and Fleet Sergeant Ho, a recruiter for the armed forces of the Terran Federation.\r\n\r\nDubois serves as a stand-in for Heinlein throughout the novel, and delivers what is probably the book's most famous soliloquy on violence, and how it \"has settled more issues in history than has any other factor.\" Fleet Sergeant Ho's monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military tirades appear in the book primarily as a contrast with Dubois. (It is later revealed that his rants are calculated to scare off the weaker applicants).\r\n\r\nInterspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico's high school History and Moral Philosophy course, which describe how in the Terran Federation of Rico's day, the rights of a full Citizen (to vote, and hold public office) must be earned through some form of volunteer Federal service. Those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this Federal Service retain the other rights generally associated with a modern democracy (free speech, assembly, etc.), but they cannot vote or hold public office. This structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the 20th century Western democracies, brought on by both social failures at home and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas (assumed looking forward into the late 20th century from the time the novel was written in the late 1950s).\r\n\r\nIn the next section of the novel Rico goes to boot camp at Camp Arthur Currie, on the northern prairies. Five chapters are spent exploring Rico's experience entering the service under the training of his instructor, Career Ship's Sergeant Charles Zim. Camp Currie is so rigorous that less than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training; the rest either resign, are expelled, or die in training. One of the chapters deals with Ted Hendrick, a fellow recruit and constant complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer. Another recruit, a deserter who committed a heinous crime while AWOL, is hanged by his battalion. Rico himself is flogged for poor handling of (simulated) nuclear weapons during a drill; despite these experiences he eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit.\r\n\r\nAt some point during Rico's training, the 'Bug War' has begun to brew, and Rico finds himself taking part in combat operations. The war \"officially\" starts with an Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires, although Rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there were plenty of \"'incidents,' 'patrols,' or 'police actions.'\" Rico briefly describes the Terran Federation's loss at the Battle of Klendathu where his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed. Following Klendathu, the Terran Federation is reduced to making hit-and-run raids similar to the one described at the beginning of the novel (which, chronologically would be placed between Chapters 10 and 11). Rico meanwhile finds himself posted to Rasczak's Roughnecks, named after Lieutenant Rasczak (his first name is never given). This part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military life, as well as the relationship between officers and non-commissioned officers, personified in this case by Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal.\r\n\r\nEventually, Rico decides to become a career soldier and attends Officer Candidate School, which turns out to be just like boot camp, only \"squared and cubed with books added.\"[15] Rico is commissioned a temporary Third Lieutenant as a field-test final exam and commands his own unit during Operation Royalty; eventually he graduates as a Second Lieutenant and full-fledged officer.\r\n\r\nThe final chapter serves as more of a coda, depicting Rico aboard the Rodger Young as the lieutenant in command of Rico's Roughnecks, preparing to drop to Klendathu as part of a major strike, with his father (having joined the Service earlier in the novel) as his senior sergeant and a Third Lieutenant-in-training of his own under his wing."}, "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["573823"], "librarything": ["7802"]}, "publishers": ["Gustav Lubbe Verlag GmbH"], "publish_date": "September 1, 1959", "revision": 8, "number_of_pages": 334}, {"title": "All Things Wise and Wonderful (All Creatures Great and Small #5-6)", "authors": ["James Herriot"], "subjects": ["Open Library Staff Picks", "Veterinarians", "Biography", "Large type books"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Readers adored James Herriot's tales of his life as a Yorkshire animal doctor in the first two collections in the \u201cAll Creatures Great and Small\u201d series.

Both suspenseful and beautifully crafted, *Snow Falling on Cedars* portrays the psychology of a community, the ambiguities of justice, the racism that persists even between neighbors, and the necessity of individual moral action despite the indifference of nature and circumstance."}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Bloomsbury Publishing Plc"], "publish_date": "1994", "revision": 2, "number_of_pages": 0}, {"title": "Moon Called", "authors": ["Patricia Briggs"], "subjects": ["Fiction, fantasy, general", "Fiction, romance, paranormal"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "\"Mercy is a shapeshifter, and though she was raised by werewolves, she can never be one of them, especially after the pack ran her off for having a forbidden love affair.

Then, to her amazement, the \u201ccoolest girl in the world\u201d moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer\u2019s end they\u2019ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable.\r\n\r\nSo begins Kristin Hannah\u2019s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. \r\n\r\nKate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn\u2019t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she\u2019ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she\u2019ll envy her famous best friend. . . .\r\n\r\nFor thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they\u2019ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.\r\n\r\nFirefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone\u2019s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it\u2019s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It\u2019s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you\u2019ll never forget . . . one you\u2019ll want to pass on to your best friend."}, "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["7174346"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Brilliance Audio on MP3-CD"], "publish_date": "February 5, 2008", "revision": 6}, {"title": "Into the Water", "authors": ["Paula Hawkins"], "subjects": ["Fiction, psychological", "Fiction, thrillers, general", "Fiction, thrillers", "nyt:trade-fiction-paperback=2018-05-20", "New York Times bestseller"], "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Transworld Publishers Limited"], "publish_date": "2017", "revision": 2}, {"title": "Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life (Scott Pilgrim, Vol. 1)", "authors": ["Bryan Lee O'Malley"], "subjects": ["New York Times bestseller", "nyt:paperback_graphic_books=2010-03-06", "Graphic novels", "Teenagers", "Comic books, strips", "Comics & graphic novels, general", "High school students", "Bildungsromans", "Coming of age"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Scott Pilgrim's life is fantastic.

He argues that Musk -- one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history -- is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.

Coates recapitulates American history and explains to his son the \"racist violence that has been woven into American culture.\" Coates draws from an abridged, autobiographical account of his youth in Baltimore, detailing the ways in which institutions like the school, the police, and even \"the streets\" discipline, endanger, and threaten to disembody black men and women. The work takes structural and thematic inspiration from James Baldwin's 1963 epistolary book The Fire Next Time. Unlike Baldwin, Coates sees white supremacy as an indestructible force, one that Black Americans will never evade or erase, but will always struggle against.\r\n\r\nThe novelist Toni Morrison wrote that Coates filled an intellectual gap in succession to James Baldwin. Editors of The New York Times and The New Yorker described the book as exceptional.

Set at an unspecified date in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with the Formics, an insectoid alien species they dub the \"buggers\". In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, children, including the novel's protagonist, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin, are trained from a very young age by putting them through increasingly difficult games, including some in zero gravity, where Ender's tactical genius is revealed.\r\n\r\nThe book originated as a short story of the same name, published in the August 1977 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact. The novel was published on January 15, 1985. Later, by elaborating on characters and plotlines depicted in the novel, Card was able to write additional books in the Ender's Game series. Card also released an updated version of Ender's Game in 1991, changing some political facts to reflect the times more accurately (e.g., to include the recent collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War). The novel has been translated into 34 languages.\r\n\r\nReception of the book has been mostly positive. It has become suggested reading for many military organizations, including the United States Marine Corps. Ender's Game was recognized as \"best novel\" by the 1985 Nebula Award[3] and the 1986 Hugo Award[4] in the genres of science fiction and fantasy. Its four sequels\u2014Speaker for the Dead (1986), Xenocide (1991), Children of the Mind (1996), and Ender in Exile (2008)\u2014follow Ender's subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the later novella A War of Gifts (2007) and novel Ender's Shadow (1999), plus other novels in the Shadow saga, take place during the same time period as the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n - [Ender's Game: 1/2](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19647657W/Ender's_Game._1_2)\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/endersgame/", "publishers": ["Tor Books"], "revision": 3}, {"title": "The fiery cross", "authors": ["Wyn Craig Wade"], "subjects": ["History", "Ku Klux Klan", "Ku Klux Klan (1915- )", "Race discrimination", "Racism", "White supremacy movements", "Ku klux klan (1915-)"], "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["1063398"], "librarything": ["116940"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Simon and Schuster"], "publish_date": "1986", "publish_places": ["New York"], "revision": 4}, {"title": "Two for the dough", "authors": ["Janet Evanovich"], "subjects": ["Bounty hunters", "Fiction", "Stephanie Plum (Fictitious character)", "Women detectives", "Mystery fiction", "Private investigators", "Detective and mystery stories", "Large type books", "Fiction, mystery & detective, women sleuths", "Plum, stephanie (fictitious character), fiction", "Trenton (n.j.), fiction", "Fiction, humorous", "nyt:e-book-fiction=2012-02-19", "New York Times bestseller", "Fiction, humorous, general", "Fiction, thrillers, crime", "Fiction, crime", "Fiction, media tie-in"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Stephanie Plum is still an inexperienced bounty hunter, so her boss and cousin Vinnie gives her an easy case: apprehend local boy Kenny Mancuso, accused of shooting his best friend in the knee and then jumping bail.

In UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders.\r\n\r\nAt the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously-researched account of this \"divinely inspired\" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith.  \r\n\r\nAlong the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America's fastest-growing religion and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief. Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty thousand Mormon fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God.\r\n\r\nMarrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five \"plural wives,\" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.\r\n\r\nWeaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism's violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.\r\n\r\nFrom the hardcover edition."}, "identifiers": {"librarything": ["5179"], "goodreads": ["830716"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Doubleday"], "publish_date": "2003", "publish_places": ["New York"], "revision": 9, "number_of_pages": 372}, {"title": "Dreamcatcher", "authors": ["Stephen King"], "subjects": ["male friendship", "life on other planets", "telepathy", "Down Syndrome", "psychological fiction", "extraterrestrial beings", "hunting", "friendship", "Fiction", "Human-alien encounters", "Fear", "Fantasy Fiction", "Roman fantastique", "Audiobooks", "hunting stories", "camping", "Fiction, horror", "Maine, fiction", "American literature", "LITERATURE", "NOVEL", "Horror fiction", "Science/Fantasy Fiction", "Fiction, suspense", "Spanish fiction", "Literatura estadounidense", "Novela", "Rencontres avec les extraterrestres", "Romans, nouvelles", "Seres extraterrestres"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Dreamcatcher is a 2001 science fiction horror novel by American writer Stephen King, featuring elements of body horror, suspense and alien invasion."}, "publishers": ["New English Library Ltd"], "revision": 3}, {"title": "Modern Romance", "authors": ["Aziz Ansari", "Eric Klinenberg"], "subjects": ["relationships", "sociology", "diversity", "gender", "romance", "race", "dating", "technology", "class", "Courtship", "Man-woman relationships", "Humor", "Effect of technological innovations on", "Dating (Social customs)", "Social media", "Humor, topic, men, women & relationships", "Dating (social customs.)", "Man-woman relationship", "nyt:combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction=2015-07-05", "New York Times bestseller", "History", "Dating (social customs)"], "description": "From NYU Wagner: \r\n\r\nAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love.

Time is running out on all levels of the Tower, but unless our ka-tet can defeat the minions of Thunderclap both in our world and in Mid-World, they will never reach that great lynchpin of the time/space continuum which, even now, begins to totter . . .\r\n([source][2])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL81600W/The_Dark_Tower_1-7\r\n  [2]: https://stephenking.com/library/novel/dark_tower_wolves_of_the_calla_the.html", "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["851748"], "librarything": ["6106"]}, "revision": 8, "number_of_pages": 816}, {"title": "Beautiful bastard", "authors": ["Christina Lauren"], "subjects": ["FICTION / Contemporary Women", "FICTION / Romance / General", "Fiction, women", "Fiction, romance, erotica", "nyt:trade-fiction-paperback=2013-03-03", "New York Times bestseller"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "\"An ambitious intern.

Lonesome Dove is the story of a cattle drive from Texas to Montana -- and much more. It is a drive that represents for everybody involved not only a Darin, even a foolhardy, adventure, but a part of the American Dream--the attempt to carve out of the last remaining wilderness a new life.\r\n\r\nAugustus McCrae and W. F. Call are former Texas Rangers, partners and friends who have shared hardship and danger together without ever quite understanding (or wanting to understand) each other's deepest emotions. Gus is the romantic, a reluctant rancher who has a way with women and the sense to leave well enough alone. Call is a driven, demanding man, a natural authority figure with no patience for weakness, and not many of his own. He is obsessed with the dream of creating his own empire, and with the need to conceal a secret sorrow of his own. The two men could hardly be more different, but both are tough, redoubtable fighters who have learned to count on each other, if nothing else. \r\n\r\nCall's dream not only drags Gus along in its wake, but draws in a vast cast of characters:\r\n-Lorena, the whore with the proverbial heart of gold, whom Gus (and almost everyone else) loves, and who. Survives one of the most terrifying experiences any woman could have...\r\n-Elmira, the restless, reluctant wife of a small-time Arkansas sheriff, who runs away from the security of marriage to become part of the great Western adventure...\r\n--Blue Duck, the sinister Indian renegade, one of the most frightening villains in American fiction, whose steely capacity for cruelty affects the lives of everyone in the book...\r\n-Newt, the young cowboy for whom the long and dangerous journey from Texas to Montana is in fact a search for his own identity...\r\n-Jake, the dashing, womanising ex-ranger, a comrade-in-arms of Gus and Call, whose weakness leads him to an unexpected fate...\r\n-July Johnson, husband of Elmira, whose love for her draws him out of his secure life into a kind of hero...\r\n\r\nLonesome Dove seeps from the Rio Grande (where Gus and Call acquire the cattle for their long drive by raiding the Mexicans) to the Montana highlands (where they find themselves besieged by the last, defiant remnants of an older West).\r\n\r\nIt is an epic of love, heroism, loyalty, honour, and betrayal--faultlessly written, unfailingly dramatic. Lonesome Dove is the novel about the West that American literature--and the American reader--has long been waiting for.\r\n--jacket\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nContains:\r\n\r\n - [Lonesome Dove: 2/2](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL134565W)", "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Audio Vision Canada"], "publish_places": ["S.l"], "revision": 5}, {"title": "The Way of Shadows", "authors": ["Brent Weeks"], "subjects": ["fantasy", "assassination", "wetboy", "Fiction", "Assassins", "Fiction, fantasy, epic", "Fantasy fiction"], "description": "For Durzo Blint, assassination is an art.

Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets.

They are joined by Sara Howard, a brave and determined woman who works as a secretary in the police department. Laboring in secret (for alienists, and the emerging discipline of psychology, are viewed by the public with skepticism at best), the unlikely team embarks on what is a revolutionary effort in criminology-- amassing a psychological profile of the man they're looking for based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who has killed before. and will kill again before the hunt is over.        Fast-paced and gripping, infused with a historian's exactitude, The Alienist  conjures up the Gilded Age and its untarnished underside: verminous tenements and opulent mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills. Here is a New York during an age when questioning society's belief that all killers are born, not made, could have unexpected and mortal consequences.From the Paperback edition."}, "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["950268"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Wheeler Pub."], "publish_date": "1994", "publish_places": ["[Accord, Mass.]"], "revision": 8, "number_of_pages": 685}, {"title": "Poison Study", "authors": ["Maria V.

Toch beschouwen de meeste mensen de chimpansee als een irrelevante rariteit, terwijl ze zichzelf zien als sport op de ladder van het Allerhoogste. Voor een evolutionist bestaat echter geen objectieve basis waarop die ene sport boven de andere kan worden verheven. Alle mensen, dieren en planten zijn in een periode van meer dan drie miljard ge\u00ebvolueerd volgens een proces dat bekendstaat als 'natuurlijke selectie'. Binnen elke soort produceren sommige individuen een groter nageslacht dan de rest, zodat de onsterfelijke eigenschappen (genen) van de exemplaren die zich met succes hebben vermenigvuldigd, in de volgende generatie talrijker worden. Dit heet natuurlijke selectie. Wijn zijn gebouwd via natuurlijke selectie, en dat is een belangrijk gegeven voor een beter begrip van onze eigen identiteit. Een voor een behandelt Richard Dawkins de voornaamste thema's van de sociale theorie: altru\u00efstische en zelfzuchtig gedrag, de verwantschapstheorie, de theorie van de geslachtsverhoudingen, bedrog en de natuurlijke selectie van sekseverschillen. Richard Dawkins' uiteenzetting van de evolutie van onze genen is ge\u00efllustreerd met tal van voorbeelden.

Large in scope, the narrative focuses on four unlikely people who come together in a flat in the city soon after the government declares a \"State of Internal Emergency.\" Through days of bleakness and hope, their lives become entwined in circumstances no one could have foreseen.\r\n\r\nThere is Dina Dalal, a widow who makes a difficult living as a seamstress, determined not to remarry or rely on her brother's charity; Maneck Kohlah, a student from a hillstation near the Himalays, uprooted from home by his parents' wish to send him to college in the city; and Ishvar and his nephew, Omprakash, tailors by trade, who fleeing caste violence, leave their village in the interiour to find employment. The narrative reaches back in time to follow the stories of these four people - the lives they began with, the places they left behind.\r\n\r\nThis stunning portrayal of a country undergoing change is alive with enduring images; a shopkeeper gazing out over a landscape, once-beloved, now transformed by the smoke of squatters' cooking fires; a helicopter bomarding a political rally with rose petals while the Prime Minister's son floats past in a hot-air balloon; men and women being transported in open trucks to a sterilization clinic; four people tenderly piecing together their history in the squares of a quilt.\r\n\r\nMistry gives us an unforgettable community of characters, among them; Nusswan, a successful businessman and Dina's tyrannical yet well-meaning older brother; Rajaram, the hair-collector, who befriends the two tailors; Beggarmaster, who wheels and deals in human lives; the Potency Peddler, who hawks his wares on market day; Shanti, the young woman who inhabits Omprakash's most heated fantasies; Mr. Valmik, a proofreader who weeps copiously due to an allergy to printing ink; Farokh Kohlah, Maneck's melancholy father, marooned in the past, less and less able to accept the world as it must be.\r\n\r\nMistry brilliantly evokes the novel's several locales, creating scenes of startling brutality as well as moments which inhabit the gentler, more intimate realm of people's lives. Written with compassion, humour and insight into the subtleties of character, the novel explores the abiding strength and fragility of the human spirit.\r\n\r\nA Fine Balance confirms Rohinton Mistry's reputation as one of the most gifted fiction writers of today.", "identifiers": {"librarything": ["4031"], "goodreads": ["701185"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/spa"}], "revision": 7, "number_of_pages": 719}, {"title": "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon", "authors": ["Stephen King", "Peter Abrahams"], "subjects": ["Little House on the Prairie", "psychological fiction", "adventure stories", "suspense", "thrillers", "Adventure fiction", "audiobooks", "Open Library Staff Picks", "Boston Red Sox", "Pitchers (Baseball)", "Fiction", "Children of divorced parents", "Mountain life", "Large type books", "Fiction, horror", "New england, fiction", "Fiction, suspense", "American literature", "Fiction, thrillers, suspense", "wilderness survival", "children's stories", "horror fiction", "Picture books for children", "Pictorial works Juvenile fiction", "juvenile audience", "adventure and adventurers", "mountain life", "Juvenile fiction", "Pictorial works", "Toy and movable books", "Specimens", "Lost children", "Divorce", "Baseball players", "Horror stories"], "description": "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (1999) is a psychological horror novel by American writer Stephen King.", "identifiers": {}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/ger"}], "revision": 3}, {"title": "Bird box", "authors": ["Josh Malerman"], "subjects": ["Fiction, horror"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "In an apocalyptic near-future world, a mother and her two small children are followed as they make their way down a river, blindfolded, in order to avoid seeing a terrifying entity.

The Murder of the wealthy industrialist Roger Ackroyd begins the night before with the suicide of Mrs. Ferrars, a wealthy widow. Her death is believed to be an accident, until Roger Ackroyd is stabbed to death in his locked study. There are rumors she poisoned her first husband, rumors that she was being blackmailed, rumors that her secret lover was Roger Ackroyd, a man who knew too much, but no one is sure.\r\n \r\nThere's no shortage of suspects, all the members of the household stand to gain from his death, from Roger's neurotic sister-in-law who has accumulated personal debts, to a parlormaid with an uncertain history who resigned her post the afternoon of the murder. But the police focus on Ralph Paton, Ackroyd's stepson and heir, and the person with the most to gain from Roger's death. When sleuth Hercule Poirot, who is living quietly in King's Abbot, agrees to investigate, the case takes a completely different turn. Poirot exonerates all of the original suspects, and lays out a completely reasoned case that the clever and devious murderer is someone who had not come under suspicion at all - someone whose motive has nothing to do with money.\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [Five Classic Murder Mysteries](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL471533W)\r\n - [Masterpieces of Murder](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL471974W)\r\n - [More Stories to Remember: Volume II](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15146874W)\r\n - [The Murder of Roger Ackroyd / The Mystery of the Blue Train / Dumb Witness / Death on the Nile](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20909872W)\r\n - [Murders to die for](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27311029W)\r\n - [Novels](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL24535152W)\r\n - [Novels](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL26432485W)\r\n - [Works](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17307260W/Works)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.agathachristie.com/stories/the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd", "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["Alth"], "publish_places": ["(S.l.)"], "revision": 5, "number_of_pages": 187}, {"title": "The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight", "authors": ["Jennifer E.

Baconians are trying to convince the world that Francis Bacon really wrote Shakespeare, there are riots between the Surrealists and Impressionists, and thousands of men are named John Milton, an homage to the real Milton and a very confusing situation for the police. Amidst all this, Acheron Hades, Third Most Wanted Man In the World, steals the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit and kills a minor character, who then disappears from every volume of the novel ever printed! But that's just a prelude . . . Hades' real target is the beloved Jane Eyre, and it's not long before he plucks her from the pages of Bronte's novel. Enter Thursday Next. She's the Special Operative's renowned literary detective, and she drives a Porsche. With the help of her uncle Mycroft's Prose Portal, Thursday enters the novel to rescue Jane Eyre from this heinous act of literary homicide. It's tricky business, all these interlopers running about Thornfield, and deceptions run rampant as their paths cross with Jane, Rochester, and Miss Fairfax. Can Thursday save Jane Eyre and Bronte's masterpiece? And what of the Crimean War? Will it ever end? And what about those annoying black holes that pop up now and again, sucking things into time-space voids . . .

An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study.

D\u00e9bordant de chaleur, d'humour, de compassion, et fort d'une galerie de personnages inoubliables, ce chef-d'oeuvre nous d\u00e9voile un peuple qui, face \u00e0 la terrible r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la mort, a choisi la vie.--[Memento]."}, "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["247922"], "librarything": ["146142"]}, "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "publishers": ["St. Martin's Press"], "publish_date": "2003", "publish_places": ["New York"], "revision": 7, "number_of_pages": 389}, {"title": "Chocolat", "authors": ["Joanne Harris"], "subjects": ["Literature", "Cities and towns", "Lent", "France", "Chocolate", "Fiction", "Village communities", "Pleasure", "Single mothers", "Fiction, general", "France, fiction", "Large type books"], "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "A tantalising novel about the ultimate luxury and sin: that dark mistress, chocolate.Try me...Test me...Taste me.When an exotic stranger, Vianne Rocher, arrives in the French village of Lansquenet and opens a chocolate boutique directly opposite the church, Father Reynaud identifies her as a serious danger to his flock \u2013 especially as it is the beginning of Lent, the traditional season of self-denial. War is declared as the priest denounces the newcomer's wares as instruments of murder.Suddenly Vianne's shop-cum-cafe means that there is somewhere for secrets to be whispered, grievances to be aired, dreams to be tested. But Vianne's plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community in a conflict that escalates into a 'Church not Chocolate' battle. As mouths water in anticipation, can the solemnity of the Church compare with the pagan passion of a chocolate eclair?For the first time here is a novel in which chocolate enjoys its true importance, emerging as a moral issue, as an agent of transformation \u2013 as well as a pleasure bordering on obsession.
